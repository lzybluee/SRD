### PSIONIC MONSTERS

### PSIONIC CREATURES

Any creature with psionic powers has the psionic subtype. A psionic
creature can be born with the subtype or can gain the subtype during its
life.

A creature meeting any one of the following criteria has the psionic
subtype:

• Creatures with a power point reserve, including characters who have
levels in a character class that grants them a power point reserve or
creatures who have the Wild Talent feat.

• Creatures with psi-like abilities, including characters who have
racial psi-like abilities.

• Creatures that have spell-like abilities described as “psionics.”

*Traits:* Other than the fact that all psionic creatures have psionic
powers, power points, or psi-like abilities, psionic creatures have no
specific traits. The psionic subtype serves to identify creatures that
may be vulnerable to powers, spells, and effects targeting psionic
creatures.

### 

### THE PSIONIC SUBTYPE

The psionic subtype applies to creatures that can use psionic powers or
abilities or that have the ability to manifest powers. (In other words,
a creature with the psionic subtype either has a power point reserve or
has psi-like abilities.) It also applies to creatures from other sources
that have spell-like abilities labeled as “psionics.”

Characters who have levels in any class that grants the use of psionics,
or who have psi-like abilities as racial traits, gain the psionic
subtype.

**Traits:** Other than the fact that all psionic creatures have psionic
powers or psi-like abilities, psionic creatures have no specific traits.
The psionic subtype simply identifies creatures that may be vulnerable
to powers, spells, and effects targeting psionic creatures.

# Undead Psionic Creatures

A psionic undead creature, although rare, is a force to be reckoned
with.

Because undead are immune to mind-affecting effects (including charms
and compulsions), they are particularly threatening to other psionic
creatures and characters (especially telepaths). Psionic undead
creatures can use mind-affecting powers on the living, even though they
themselves are immune to such attacks. However, an undead creature may
have the psionic subtype if it meets the criteria described above, and
thus be vulnerable to non-mindaffecting powers or effects that
specifically affect psionic creatures.

Intelligent constructs and plants with psionic powers or psi-like
abilities also share this advantage.

### PSIONIC POWERS

Creatures with psionic powers are similar to creatures with racial
spellcasting ability. They have the ability to manifest powers just as a
member of a psionic character class can (and can activate psionic items
accordingly).

Creatures with the ability to use powers are subject to the same rules
for manifesting powers that characters are, but they are not actually
members of a class and do not gain any class abilities unless otherwise
specified.

Creatures with psionic powers generally emulate the manifesting ability
of a particular psionic class. When such a creature takes levels in that
same class, it can stack its innate psionic powers and its class power
progression together.

Creatures with psionic powers that take levels in a class other than the
one they emulate combine their two power point reserves into a single
reserve, but they manifest powers from each psionic class separately.

### PSI-LIKE ABILITIES

Most psionic monsters have some number of psi-like abilities. These are
very similar to spell-like abilities. Naturally, they are psionic and
work just like powers or spells. A creature with psi-like abilities does
not pay for these abilities with power points and does not pay any XP
cost associated with manifesting the power the ability duplicates.

Psi-like abilities do not work in a *null psionics field* and are
subject to power resistance if the power or spell the ability duplicates
would be subject to power resistance. A psi-like ability usually has a
limit on how often it can be used. A psi-like ability that can be used
at will has no use limit. Using a psi-like ability is a standard action
unless noted otherwise, and doing so while threatened provokes attacks
of opportunity. It is possible to make a Concentration check to use a
psi-like ability defensively and avoid provoking attacks of opportunity,
just as when using a power or casting a spell. A psi-like ability can be
interrupted just as a spell can be. Psi-like abilities cannot be used to
counterspell, nor can they be counterspelled.

All creatures with psi-like abilities are assigned a manifester level,
which indicates how difficult it is to dispel their psi-like effects and
determines all level-dependent variables (such as range or duration) the
abilities might have. When a creature uses a psi-like ability, the power
is manifested as if the creature had spent a number of power points
equal to its manifester level, which may augment the power to improve
its damage or save DC. However, the creature does not actually spend
power points for its psi-like abilities, even if it has a power point
reserve due to racial abilities, class levels, or some other psionic
ability.

The DC of a saving throw (if applicable) against a creature’s psi-like
ability is 10 + the level of the power or spell the ability duplicates +
the creature’s Cha modifier. Remember to check the power’s Augment entry
to see if the creature’s manifester level (and thus the effective power
point expenditure) increases the DC of the saving throw. Changes to the
effect’s save DC, damage, and so on are noted in the psi-like ability
entry.

# Psionic Focus

Some creatures have feats that can be used only when the creature is
psionically focused, or that require the creature to expend its psionic
focus. Assume that such a creature is psionically focused before
entering combat.

# Psi-Like Abilities and Feats

Creatures with access to psi-like abilities can use the feats Empower
Spell-Like Ability and Quicken Spell-Like Ability.

These feats can be used only on psi-like abilities that do not have
increased effects due to augmentation. Furthermore, the creature can
empower only a psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to half
its manifester level (round down) minus 2, and can quicken only a
psi-like ability with a level less than or equal to half its manifester
level (round down) minus 4.

# Creatures with “Psionics” Entries

Psionic monsters often possess spell-like abilities that are identified
as “psionics,” instead of “spell-like abilities.” For all intents and
purposes, creatures with spell-like abilities described as psionics are
considered to possess psi-like abilities, and they manifest their powers
as described above.

# Psionic Spells

In some cases, a creature’s psi-like abilities (or abilities listed
under a creature’s psionics entry) may include an effect that does not
duplicate any listed power. For such abilities, simply use the existing
spell description*.* Treat the creature’s

manifester level as the caster level for the spell. The ability is still
psionic in origin, so spells and powers that specifically affect psionic
powers can negate or reduce its effects as they would any other psionic
power.

# Psionic Versions Of Creatures

Below are presented psionic versions of the following creatures*:*
aboleth, couatl, and duergar,. These alternate versions are psionic
equivalents of their standard counterparts.

Only the portions of the monster entry that are specifically changed by
the addition of psionics rules have been listed. All other elements of
the creature remain the same.

### READING PSIONIC CREATURE ENTRIES

# Creatures with Psi-Like Abilities

Each of a creature’s psi-like abilities has a manifester level. Each
ability that allows a saving throw also gives a save DC in parentheses
following the power name.

Powers that have increased effects due to augmentation include
information about the effect. An asterisk indicates that the power has
already been augmented by the creature’s innate ability.

Powers that can’t be augmented, or that are manifested at their normal
minimum level, do not contain any special notations. Resolve the effect
of manifesting the power without augmentation at the creature’s given
manifester level.

Some creatures may have particular powers that are manifested at a
higher or lower level than their normal manifester level. In such cases,
the manifester level is given in the parenthetical information following
the power name.

ABOLETH, PSIONIC

Huge Aberration (Aquatic, Psionic)

**Special Attacks:** Psi-like abilities, slime

**Feats:** Alertness, Combat Manifestation, Iron Will

### COMBAT

A psionic aboleth does not possess spell-like abilities or the enslave
ability of the standard aboleth. Instead, it has psi-like abilities,
including *psionic dominate.*

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*disable* (30-ft. cone, 12 HD, DC 20\*),
*false sensory input* (five targets, DC 16\*), *mental disruption*
(20-ft. radius*,* DC 18\*), *mindlink* (unwilling, nine targets, DC
14\*); 3/day—*ego whip* (ML 7th, 2d4, DC 17\*)*, id insinuation* (ML
7th, three targets, DC 17\*)*, psionic dominate* (any target, 24 hours,
DC 20\*), *thought shield* (power resistance 21, 3 rounds\*);
1/day—*psionic modify memory* (DC 17)*, remote viewing* (DC 17)*, wall
of ectoplasm* (DC 17)*.*

Manifester level 13th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the aboleth’s manifester level.

ASTRAL CONSTRUCT

Astral constructs are brought into being by the metacreativity power
*astral construct*. They are formed from raw ectoplasm (a portion of the
astral medium drawn into the Material Plane). The power points spent by
the construct’s creator during the manifestation of the power determine
the level of the astral construct created. However, even astral
constructs of the same level vary somewhat from each other, depending on
the whims of their creators.

### COMBAT

Astral constructs act as directed by their creators. As a free action, a
construct’s manifester can direct the construct to attack particular
enemies, use specific tactics or powers, perform other actions, or do
nothing at all. The construct does exactly what its creator directs it
to do.

An astral construct generally appears as an animate clump of ectoplasm
with a vaguely humanoid shape, but the manifester can mold or sculpt one
according to his or her whim within the limits imposed by the creature’s
size. The quality of such “construct sculpture” is determined by a Craft
(sculpting) check. A result of 10 to 19 creates a creature that is
recognizably similar to the desired creature shape; a result of 20 to 29
creates a construct that looks like an accurate portrayal of that
creature type; a result of 30 or higher creates a construct that looks
like a specific individual. No matter how high the Craft (sculpting)
check result, though, an astral construct’s appearance can’t hide the
otherworldly material from which it is formed.

**Construct Traits:** An astral construct has immunity to poison,
*sleep,* paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy
effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude
save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject
to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain,
fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can
be repaired.

**Special Abilities:** Every time an astral construct is created, the
manifester can choose to apply one special ability to the construct.
When the manifester begins to manifest the *astral construct* power, he
chooses one or more special abilities from a menu of abilities
appropriate to that level of astral construct.

### CREATING AN ASTRAL CONSTRUCT

When manifesting the *astral construct* power, the manifester assembles
the desired creature from a menu of choices, as specified in the
construct’s statistics block. A manifester can always substitute two
choices from a lesser menu for one of its given abilities. Multiple
selections of the same menu choice do not stack unless the ability
specifically notes that stacking is allowed.

Some menu choices grant an astral construct the ability to manifest
specific powers as psi-like abilities. Unless using the ability is a
free action, an astral construct manifesting such a power does so as a
standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity. All such powers
have a manifester level equal to the astral construct’s Hit Dice or the
creator’s manifester level, whichever is lower.

An astral construct does not need to meet the prerequisites for a feat
granted by a menu choice.

# Astral Construct Menu A

A manifester creating a 1st-level, 2nd-level, or 3rd-level astral
construct can choose one special ability from this menu.

**Buff (Ex):** The astral construct gains an extra 5 hit points.

**Celerity (Ex):** The astral construct’s land speed is increased by 10
feet.

**Cleave (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Cleave feat.

**Deflection (Ex):** The astral construct gains a +1 deflection bonus to
Armor Class.

**Fly (Ex):** The astral construct has physical wings and a fly speed of
20 feet (average).

**Improved Bull Rush (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Improved
Bull Rush feat.

**Improved Slam Attack (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Improved
Natural Attack feat.

**Mobility (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Mobility feat.

**Power Attack (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Power Attack feat.

**Resistance (Ex):** Choose one of the following energy types: fire,
cold, acid, electricity, or sonic. The astral construct gains resistance
5 against that energy type.

**Swim (Ex):** The astral construct is streamlined and shark like, and
gains a swim speed of 30 feet.

**Trip (Ex):** If the astral construct hits with a slam attack, it can
attempt to trip the opponent as a free action without making a touch
attack or provoking attacks of opportunity. If the attempt fails, the
opponent cannot react to trip the astral construct.

# Astral Construct Menu B

A manifester creating a 4th-level, 5th-level, or 6th-level astral
construct can choose one special ability from this menu. Alternatively,
the construct can have two special abilities from Menu A.

**Energy Touch (Ex):** If you are a kineticist, the astral construct’s
physical attacks are wreathed in your energy type, dealing an extra 1d6
points of energy damage. If you are not a kineticist, the astral
construct deals an extra 1d4 points of damage of an energy type you
choose (fire, cold, acid, or electricity) when you manifest the
construct.

**Extra Attack:** If the astral construct is Medium or smaller, it gains
two slam attacks instead of one when it makes a full attack. Its bonus
on damage rolls for each attack is equal to its Strength modifier, not
its Strength modifier x 1-1/2. If the astral construct is Large or
larger, it gains three slams instead of two when it makes a full attack.
Its attacks are otherwise unchanged.

**Fast Healing (Ex):** The astral construct heals 2 hit points each
round. It is still immediately destroyed when it reaches 0 hit points.

**Heavy Deflection (Ex):** The astral construct gains a +4 deflection
bonus to Armor Class.

**Improved Buff (Ex):** The astral construct gains an extra 15 hit
points.

**Improved Critical (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Improved
Critical feat with its slam attacks.

**Improved Damage Reduction (Ex):** The astral construct’s surface forms
a hard carapace and provides an additional 3 points of damage reduction
(or damage reduction 3/magic if it does not already have damage
reduction).

**Improved Fly (Ex):** The astral construct has physical wings and a fly
speed of 40 feet (average).

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, the construct must hit with
its slam attack. A construct can use this ability only on a target that
is at least one size smaller than itself.

Improved Swim: The astral construct is streamlined and sharklike, and
gains a swim speed of 60 feet.

**Muscle (Ex):** The astral construct gains a +4 bonus to its Strength
score.

**Poison Touch (Ex):** If the astral construct hits with a melee attack,
the target must make an initial Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1/2 astral
construct’s HD + astral construct’s Cha modifier) or take 1 point of
Constitution damage. One minute later, the target must save again or
take 1d2 points of Constitution damage.

**Pounce (Ex):** If the astral construct charges a foe, it can make a
full attack.

**Smite (Su):** Once per day the astral construct can make one attack
that deals extra damage equal to its Hit Dice.

**Trample (Ex):** As a standard action during its turn each round, a
Large or larger astral construct can literally run over an opponent at
least one size smaller than itself. It merely has to move over the
opponent to deal bludgeoning damage equal to 1d8 + its Str modifier. The
target can attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 astral construct’s Hit
Dice + astral construct’s Str modifier) to negate the damage, or it can
instead choose to make an attack of opportunity at a –4 penalty.

# Astral Construct Menu C

A manifester creating a 7th-level, 8th-level, or 9th-level astral
construct can choose one special ability from this menu. Alternatively,
the astral construct can have two special abilities from Menu B. (One or
both of the Menu B choices can be swapped for two choices from Menu A.)

**Blindsight (Ex):** The astral construct has blindsight out to 60 feet.

**Concussion (Sp):** The astral construct can manifest *concussion
blast* (manifester level 7th) as a free action once per round.

**Constrict (Ex):** The astral construct has the improved grab ability
with its slam attack. In addition, on a successful grapple check, the
astral construct deals damage equal to its slam damage.

**Dimension Slide (Sp):** The astral construct can manifest *dimension
slide* (manifester level equal to Hit Dice) as a move action once per
round.

**Energy Bolt (Sp):** The astral construct can manifest *energy bolt*
(manifester level 8th) as a standard action once per round. The creator
sets the energy type that the astral construct can manifest when he
creates it.

**Extra Buff (Ex):** The astral construct gains an extra 30 hit points.

**Extreme Damage Reduction (Ex):** The astral construct’s surface forms
hard, armor-like plates and provides an additional 6 points of damage
reduction.

**Extreme Deflection (Ex):** The astral construct gains a +8 deflection
bonus to Armor Class.

**Natural Invisibility (Su):** The astral construct is constantly
invisible, even when attacking. This ability is inherent and not subject
to the *invisibility purge* spell.

**Power Resistance (Ex):** The astral construct gains power resistance
equal to 10 + its Hit Dice.

**Rend (Ex):** The astral construct makes claw attacks instead of slam
attacks (it deals the same amount of damage as it would with its slam
damage, but does slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage). An
astral construct that hits the same opponent with two claw attacks in
the same round rends its foe, which deals extra damage equal to 2d6 +
1-1/2 times its Str modifier.

**Spring Attack (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Spring Attack
feat.

**Whirlwind Attack (Ex):** The astral construct gains the Whirlwind
Attack feat.

Blues are a subrace of goblins with an innate knack for psionics. A blue
is often smaller than an average goblin, standing just about 3 feet tall
and weighing about 40 pounds. Blues have noticeably blue-tinged skin,
and their eyes are less dull than those of a common goblin. Otherwise,
they resemble their kin. They generally dress in short leather robes,
dyed black.

Blues speak Goblin and Common.

Most blues encountered outside their homes are psions; the information
in the statistics block is for a psion of 1st level.

### COMBAT

Brain moles are burrowing animals that use psionic powers to overcome
large psionic prey. Small, furry, and nearly blind, brain moles are
almost indistinguishable from their common animal cousins.

Brain moles eat small insects when they can’t get psionic energy.

### COMBAT

Brain moles hunger for psionic energy. They hide in loose dirt and
detritus on forest floors, watching for the approach of psionic
creatures with their *detect psionics* power. When a suitable target
comes in range, the brain moles then attack with their *power leech*
ability. The moles remain hidden as long as possible. If threatened,
they use *aversion* and *mind thrust* to discourage attackers, using
their bite only as a last resort.

**Cascade Flu (Ex):** Disease—bite; Fortitude DC 9, incubation period
one day, damage psionic cascade (every time an afflicted character
manifests a power, she must make a DC 16 Concentration check; on a
failed check, a psionic cascade is triggered \[see Psionic Maladies\]).
The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*detect psionics, power leech* (ML 5th,
DC 14)*;* 3/day—*aversion* (DC 12)*, mind thrust* (DC 11)*.* Manifester
level 1st. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Hide Mind (Su):** A brain mole cannot be identified as psionic by
divination spells or clairsentience powers.

**Power Conversion (Su):** When a brain mole drains a power point by
means of its *power leech* power, it immediately heals 1 hit point. If
it is already at full normal hit points, it instead gains psionic
sustenance sufficient to supply its need for nourishment for 24 hours.

**Skills:** Brain moles have a +4 racial bonus on Hide and Move Silently
checks and a –2 racial penalty on Spot checks.

A caller in darkness is an incorporeal creature composed of the minds of
dozens of victims who died together in terror. It seeks to draw others
into its fearwracked, hellish existence.

Callers in darkness rarely speak, but when they do, they speak Common.

## COMBAT

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*clairvoyant sense, concussion blast*
(two targets, 3d6\*)*, detect psionics, ego whip* (2d4, DC 16\*), *mind
thrust* (7d10, DC 16\*); 3/day—*death urge* (DC 16), *psychic crush* (DC
13\*\*), *psionic suggestion* (three targets, DC 14\*); 1/ day—*co-opt
concentration* (DC 18). Manifester level 7th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the caller’s manifester level.

\*\*Includes the inherent +4 save adjustment described in the power.

**Steal Essence (Su):** Any living, intelligent creature slain by a
caller in darkness’s touch attack is mentally absorbed into the
monster’s consciousness. (The physical body of the victim remains
intact). Stealing a victim’s essence is a free action; it grants the
caller 12 temporary hit points, and a permanent new screaming face
appears within its cloud.

A caller in darkness can also steal the essence of living, intelligent
creatures within 30 feet that are paralyzed or sleeping, or that are
helpless due to having a mental ability score reduced to 0 (often by the
caller’s *ego whip* attack). Doing so is a standard action that provokes
attacks of opportunity. The victim dies, and the caller gains 12
temporary hit points.

**Incorporeal Traits:** A caller in darkness is harmed only by other
incorporeal creatures, magic weapons, spells, spell-like abilities, and
supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a
corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost
touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects,
at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but
deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. The
creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with Listen checks if
it doesn’t wish to be.

**Undead Traits:** A caller in darkness is immune to mind-affecting
effects, poison, *sleep,* paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects,
and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it also works on
objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical hits, nonlethal
damage, ability damage to its physical ability scores, ability drain,
energy drain, fatigue, exhaustion, or death from massive damage. It
cannot be raised, and *resurrection* works only if it is willing. It has
darkvision out to 60 feet.

**Unnatural Aura (Su):** Animals can sense the unnatural presence of a
caller in darkness. Any animal within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will
save or become panicked until it is no longer within 30 feet of the
caller in darkness. A panicked creature that is cornered begins
cowering. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Vulnerability to Sunlight (Ex):** Callers in darkness are utterly
powerless in natural sunlight (not merely a *daylight* spell) and flee
from it. A caller caught in sunlight cannot attack and can take only a
single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor can
it take full-round actions).

COMBAT

Cerebriliths favor telepathic attacks, usually beginning a battle by
launching a furious barrage of *ego whip* and *id insinuation* attacks.
In melee, cerebriliths often use their Concentration skill to gain
psionic focus, so that they can use Psionic Fist or Unavoidable Strike
(the latter in conjunction with Power Attack).

A cerebrilith’s natural weapons, as well as any weapons it wields, are
treated as chaotic-aligned and evil-aligned for the purpose of
overcoming damage reduction.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*brain lock* (any nonmindless, DC 17\*),
*detect psionics, ego whip* (2d4, DC 19\*)*, id insinuation* (four
targets, DC 20\*)*, mind trap* (5 rounds\*)*;* 3/day—*psionic dominate*
(24 hours, DC 20\*), *ectoplasmic form*, *mind probe* (DC 20);
1/day—*mind thrust* (9d10, DC 20\*). Manifester level 9th. The save DCs
are Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the cerebrilith’s manifester level.

**Spell-Like Abilities:** At will—*deeper darkness, desecrate, detect
good, dispel good* (DC 20)*, greater teleport* (self plus 50 pounds of
objects only), *magic circle against good* (DC 18)*, unholy blight* (DC
19). Caster level 9th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Summon Demon (Sp):** Once per day a cerebrilith can attempt to summon
4d6 dretches or another cerebrilith with a 35% chance of success. This
ability is equivalent to a 4th-level spell.

**Outsider Traits:** A cerebrilith cannot be *raised, reincarnated* or
*resurrected* (though a *limited wish, wish*, *miracle*, or *true
resurrection* spell can restore life). It has darkvision out to 60 feet.

**Skills:** Cerebriliths have a +8 racial bonus on Listen and Spot
checks.

COUATL, PSIONIC

Large Outsider (Native, Psionic)

**Special Attacks:** Constrict 2d8+6, improved grab, poison, psi-like
abilities, spells

### COMBAT

The psionic couatl does not possess the psionic spell-like abilities of
the standard couatl. Instead, it has psi-like abilities*.*

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*aura sight, cloud mind* (DC 15),
*detect psionics, read thoughts* (DC 15); 3/day—*mental barrier* (2
rounds\*)*, metamorphosis, psionic plane shift, thought shield* (power
resistance 19\*)*.* Manifester level 9th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the psionic couatl’s manifester level.

A conglomerate of stone and crystal, a crysmal above all else seeks to
perpetuate its kind.

Crysmals transform mundane minerals into juvenile crysmals. Gems are the
perfect substance for this reproductive cycle: To make a single
juvenile, a crysmal generally needs eight to ten gems, each of 25 gp
value or more.

Crysmals understand Terran but do not speak.

### COMBAT

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*control object, control sound, detect
psionics, empty mind, mind thrust* (2d10, DC 13\*); 3/day—*psionic

pounds. They have iridescent compound eyes. Dromites wear heavy boots
and light clothing, and are sometimes content with just a sturdy
harness.

Dromites speak Common.

Most dromites encountered outside their homes are warriors; the
information in the statistics block is for a warrior of 1st level.

COMBAT

**Psi-Like Abilities:** 1/day: *energy ray* (fire, 1d6+1)*.* Manifester
level 1st. The save DC is Charisma-based. (Other dromites may manifest
electricity, cold, or sonic *energy rays* instead; the *energy ray*
always matches the type of energy the dromite is resistant to.)

The dromite warrior presented here had the following ability scores
before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

DROMITES AS CHARACTERS

Dromite characters possess the following racial traits.

— +2 Charisma, –2 Strength, –2 Wisdom.

—Small size: +1 bonus to Armor Class, +1 bonus on attack rolls, +4 bonus
on Hide checks, –4 penalty on grapple checks, lifting and carrying
limits 3/4 of those of Medium characters.

have resistance to cold, electricity, or sonics instead of fire), scent.

— Racial Skills: Dromites have a +2 racial bonus on Spot checks due to

DUERGAR, PSIONIC

Duergar, 1st-Level Warrior

Medium Humanoid (Dwarf, Psionic)

**Special Attacks:** Duergar traits, psi-like abilities

### COMBAT

A psionic duergar does not possess the spell-like abilities of standard
duergars. Instead, it has psi-like abilities*.*

**Psi-Like Abilities:** 1/day—*expansion, invisibility.* These abilities
are as the power (or spell) manifested by a psion (or sorcerer) of the
duergar’s Hit Dice (minimum 3rd level) and affect only the duergar and
whatever he carries.

### DUERGAR AS CHARACTERS

Duergar characters possess the following racial traits.

— +2 Constitution, –4 Charisma.

—Medium size.

—Duergar base land speed is 20 feet. However, gray dwarves can move at
this speed even when wearing medium or heavy armor or when carrying a
medium or heavy load (unlike other creatures, whose speed is reduced in
such situations).

—Darkvision out to 120 feet.

—Immunity to paralysis, phantasms, and poison.

— +2 racial bonus on saves against spells and spell-like effects.

—Stability: Duergar are exceptionally stable on their feet. A duergar
receives a +4 bonus on ability checks made to resist being bull rushed
or tripped when standing on the ground (but not when climbing, flying,
riding or otherwise not standing firmly on the ground).

—Stonecunning: This ability grants a duergar a +2 racial bonus on Search
checks to notice unusual stonework, such as sliding walls, stonework,
traps, new construction (even when built to match the old), unsafe stone
surfaces, shaky stone ceilings, and the like. Something that isn’t stone
but that is disguised as stone also counts as unusual stonework. A gray
dwarf who merely comes within 10 feet of unusual stonework can make a
Search check as if he were actively searching, and a duergar can use the
Search skill to find stonework traps as a rogue can. A duergar can also
intuit depth, sensing his approximate depth underground as naturally as
a human can sense which way is up.

Duergar have a sixth sense about stonework, an innate ability that they
get plenty of opportunity to practice and hone in their underground
homes.

—Psi-Like Abilities: 1/day—expansion, invisibility. These abilities
affect only the duergar and whatever he carries. Manifester level is
equal to Hit Dice (minimum 3rd).

—Naturally Psionic: Duergar gain 3 bonus power points at 1st level. This
benefit does not grant them the ability to manifest powers unless they
gain that ability through another source, such as levels in a psionic
class.

— +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against orcs (including half-orcs) and
goblinoids (including goblins, hobgoblins, and bugbears).

— +4 dodge bonus to Armor Class against creatures of the giant type
(such as ogres, trolls, and hill giants).

—Light Sensitivity (Ex): Duergar are dazzled in sunlight or within the
radius of a daylight spell.

—Duergar have a +4 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and a +1 racial
bonus on Listen and Spot checks. They have a +2 racial bonus on Appraise
and Craft checks that are related to stone or metal.

—Automatic Languages: Common, Dwarven, Undercommon. Bonus Languages:
Draconic, Giant, Goblin, Orc, Terran.

—Favored Class: Fighter.

—Level Adjustment: +1.

COMBAT

A folugub can scent a crystal object up to 90 feet away, and once it has
the scent, little deters it from its goal. It usually ceases attacking
to devour a freshly liquefied crystal. The creature targets the largest
crystal object available.

**Liquefy Crystal (Ex):** A folugub that makes a successful touch attack
with its tongue causes the target crystal to change phase, turning
immediately from solid to liquid and becoming worthless. The touch can
destroy up to a 5-foot cube of crystal instantly. Magic or psionic items
made of crystal (including crystalline armor and weapons) must succeed
on a DC 19 Reflex save or be liquefied. The save DC is
Constitution-based and includes a +4 racial modifier.

A crystalline weapon that deals damage to a folugub becomes liquefied
immediately.

### COMBAT 

A gray glutton attacks anything psionic, or anything that stands in its
way of tracking down new psionic prey. Of course, a gray glutton has to
eat—and eat a lot to feed its bulk—so when not on the scent it will
attack any living creature. It always breaks off attacks against
nonpsionic foes if psionic prey is an option. The only creatures it
refuses to eat are elves (and it dislikes the taste of dwarves). No
challenge seems too extreme to it, even if that means bulling into the
center of a powerful party of manifesters.

**Null Psionic Exhalation (Su):** As a free action, a gray glutton can
breathe forth a cloud of pale blue translucent gas into an adjacent
10-foot cube. The gas is psionically poisonous; the initial damage is
1d4 power points, and the secondary damage is 3d4 power points
(Fortitude DC 18 negates). Affected psionic characters and creatures
subtract the lost power points from their reserves.

The save DC is Constitution-based.

Once a gray glutton has used its exhalation, it must wait 4 rounds
before it can exhale again.

Half-giants typically stand from 7 feet to nearly 8 feet tall and weigh
from 250 to 400 pounds, with men noticeably taller and heavier than
women.

Half-giants speak Common. Many also learn Giant.

### COMBAT

Because of their giant ancestry, half-giants are able to use weapons
sized for creatures larger than normal humans. They gain considerable
satisfaction in using these large weapons in combat against their foes.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** 1/day: *stomp* (DC 10)*.* Manifester level equal
to 1/2 HD (minimum 1st). The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Fire Acclimated (Ex):** Half-giants have a +2 racial bonus on saving
throws against all fire spells and effects.

**Powerful Build (Ex):** The physical stature of half-giants lets them
function in many ways as if they were one size category larger. Whenever
a half-giant is subject to a size modifier or special size modifier for
an opposed check (such as during grapple checks, bull rush attempts, and
trip attempts), the half-giant is treated as one size larger if doing so
is advantageous to him. A half-giant is also considered to be one size
larger when determining whether a creature’s special attacks based on
size (such as improved grab or swallow whole) can affect him. A
half-giant can use weapons designed for a creature one size larger
without penalty. However, his space and reach remain those of a creature
of his actual size. The benefits of this racial trait stack with the
effects of powers, abilities, and spells that change the subject’s size
category.

The half-giant warrior presented here had the following ability scores
before racial adjustments: Str 13, Dex 11, Con 12, Int 10, Wis 9, Cha 8.

### HALF-GIANTS AS CHARACTERS

Half-giant characters possess the following racial traits.

— +2 Constitution, +2 Strength, –2 Dexterity.

—Medium size.

—Half-giant base land speed is 30 feet.

—Low-light vision.

—Naturally Psionic: Half-giants gain 2 bonus power points at 1st level,
regardless of whether they choose a psionic class.

—Fire Acclimated: Half-giants have a +2 racial bonus on saving throws
against all fire spells and effects.

—Powerful build (see above).

—Special Attacks (see above): Psi-like abilities.

—Automatic Language: Common. Bonus Language: Draconic, Giant, Gnoll,
Ignan.

—Favored Class: Psychic warrior.

—Level adjustment: +1.

Intellect devourers understand Common but must be in possession of a
body to speak. An intellect devourer in possession of a body also knows
the languages known by that victim.

### COMBAT

**Body Thief (Su):** When an intellect devourer overcomes a lone victim,
it consumes the victim’s brain and enters the skull. As a full-round
action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the devourer can merge its
form with that of a helpless or dead creature of Small size or larger.
The devourer cannot merge its body with that of a creature immune to
extra damage from critical hits.

When an intellect devourer completes its merging, it psionically
consumes the brain of the victim (which kills it if it is not already
dead). The devourer can exit the body at any time as a standard action,
bursting the victim’s skull and resuming its normal form.

After consuming its victim’s brain, an intellect devourer can instead
choose to animate the body for up to seven days as if it were the
victim’s original brain. The devourer retains its hit points, saving
throws, and mental ability scores, as well as its psi-like abilities. It
assumes the physical qualities and ability scores of the victim, as if
it had used *polymorph* to assume the victim’s form. As long as the
intellect devourer occupies the body, it knows the languages spoken by
the victim and very basic information about the victim’s identity and
personality, but none of the victim’s specific memories or knowledge.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*cloud mind, compression, detect
psionics, ego whip* (2d4, DC 16\*), *empty mind* (+5 on Will saves\*),
*id insinuation* (three targets, DC 16\*); 3/day—*body adjustment*
(2d12\*), *intellect fortress, painful strike.* Manifester level 7th.

The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the intellect devourer’s manifester level.

**Blindsight (Ex):** An intellect devourer can use nonvisual means to
ascertain all foes within 60 feet as a sighted creature would.

**Vulnerability to Protection from Evil (Ex):** An intellect devourer is
treated as a summoned creature for the purpose of determining how it is
affected by a *protection from evil* spell.

**Skills:** Intellect devourers have a +8 racial bonus on Bluff checks,
useful for passing off the possessed body as the original. They also
have a +8 racial bonus on Move Silently checks and Listen checks.

A mature neothelid is a gigantic worm scores of feet long and weighing
tens of thousands of pounds. Although they understand Undercommon, they
rarely communicate in a meaningful way.

### COMBAT

**Breath Weapon (Su):** Cone of acid 50 feet long, once every 1d4
rounds; damage 14d10 acid, Reflex half DC 30.

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a neothelid must hit a
creature with two tentacles during the same attack. If it gets a hold,
it automatically deals tentacle damage and can attempt to swallow the
foe.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*body equilibrium, psionic charm* (all
targets, duration 15 days, DC 21\*), *clairvoyant sense, psionic
levitate, read thoughts* (DC 17\*), *psionic suggestion* (seven targets,
DC 17\*), *telekinetic force* (500 lb., DC 18\*), *telekinetic maneuver*
(+4 bonus, DC 19\*), *telekinetic thrust* (500 lb., DC 18\*), *psionic
teleport, trace teleport, truevenom* (DC 19); 3/day—*mind thrust*
(15d10, DC 23\*), *psychic thrust* (6d6, DC 16\*\*). Manifester level
15th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the neothelid’s manifester level.

\*\*Includes the inherent +4 save adjustment described in the power.

**Swallow Whole (Ex):** A neothelid can try to swallow a grabbed
opponent of a smaller size than itself by making a successful grapple
check. Once inside, the opponent takes 2d8+15 points of crushing damage
plus 2d6 points of acid damage per round from stomach secretions. A
swallowed creature can cut its way out by using a light slashing or
piercing weapon to deal 25 points of damage to the stomach (AC 22). Once
the creature exits, muscular action closes the hole; another swallowed
opponent must cut its own way out. A neothelid’s interior can hold 1
Huge, 2 Large, 8 Medium, 32 Small, 128 Tiny, or 512 Diminutive or
smaller opponents.

**Blindsight (Ex):** A neothelid can use nonvisual means to ascertain
all foes within 100 feet as a sighted creature would.

PHRENIC CREATURE

Seemingly no different from standard examples of their kind, phrenic
creatures harbor mental might.

Monsters who naturally possess psionic ability are not found as phrenic
creatures. Phrenic creatures are freaks among their kind, otherwise
normal creatures whose minds are more powerful than those of their
fellows. Similarly, creatures who advance by character class are usually
not phrenic creatures—they simply take levels in a psionic class to hone
their mental powers.

CREATING A PHRENIC CREATURE

“Phrenic” is an inherited template that can be added to any nonmindless
creature that does not already have the psionic subtype (referred to
hereafter as the “base creature”). A phrenic creature uses all the base
creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**Size and Type:** The creature’s type does not change, unless it is an
animal (in which case it becomes a magical beast \[augmented animal\]).
It gains the psionic subtype.

**Psi-Like Abilities (Sp):** A phrenic creature possesses the psi-like
abilities indicated below, depending on its Hit Dice. The abilities are
cumulative. Unless otherwise noted, an ability is usable once per day.
Manifester level is equal to the creature’s HD. The save DCs for a
phrenic creature’s psi-like abilities are Charisma-based.

A phthisic stands 10 feet tall and weighs 600 pounds. It vaguely
resembles the person whose mind the phthisic escaped from, but is
severely distorted (someone who knows the individual from whom the
phthisic sprung can make a DC 25 Spot check to note the resemblance).

A phthisic speaks the primary language of the mind that birthed it,
usually Common.

### COMBAT

**Mind Feed (Ex):** A phthisic that hits with its bite attack deals 1d4
points of Intelligence damage. If this effect reduces the opponent’s
Intelligence score to 0, the ability damage becomes ability drain.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** 3/day—*brain lock* (affects animals, fey,
giants, humanoids, magical beasts, and monstrous humanoids, DC 15\*),
*dimension slide*, *ego whip* (1d4, DC 15\*)*, mental barrier, mind
thrust* (ML 4th, 4d10*,* DC 15\*), *skate;* 1/day—*body adjustment*
(heal 1d12\*), *catapsi* (DC 18). Manifester level 6th. The save DCs are
Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the phthisic’s manifester level.

**Regeneration (Ex):** Fire and acid deal normal damage to a phthisic.

The psicrystal described here is that of a 1st-level manifester.

### COMBAT

A psicrystal’s characteristics depend on its master. Its Hit Dice are
equal to its master’s Hit Dice (counting only levels in psion or
wilder), its hit points are equal to half its master’s, and its saving
throw bonuses are the same as its master’s.

**Construct Traits:** A psicrystal has immunity to poison, *sleep,*
paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy effects,
mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms, patterns, and
morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude save unless it
also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject to critical
hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain, fatigue,
exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can be
repaired. Psicrystals do not have the usual construct traits of
darkvision and low-light vision.

**Psicrystal Granted Abilities:** The psicrystal described here has the
special abilities of self-propulsion, alertness, improved evasion, share
powers, telepathic link, sighted, and personality (If its master chooses
not to activate the self-propulsion ability, the psicrystal reverts to a
speed of 0 feet and has no Strength score and no Dexterity score.)

**Skills:** A psicrystal (with its self-propulsion ability activated)
uses its Dexterity modifier instead of its Strength modifier on Climb
checks. It has a +8 racial bonus on Climb checks and can always choose
to take 10, even if rushed or threatened.

A psion-killer (also called a crystal golem) is 9-1/2 feet tall and
weighs around 2,500 pounds. Its body is composed of sharply faceted
crystal.

### COMBAT

A psion-killer does nothing without explicit orders from its creator. It
follows instructions literally and is incapable of any strategy or
tactics. Psion-killers don’t use weapons, even if ordered to, but always
strike with their fists.

A psion-killer’s creator can command it if the psion-killer is within 60
feet and can see and hear its creator. If uncommanded, a psion-killer
usually follows its last instruction to the best of its ability, though
if attacked it returns the attack. Its creator can give a psion-killer a
simple command to govern its actions in his or her absence.

**Dispel Psionics (Su):** A psion-killer can use *dispel psionics* as a
free action once per round. The effect is as an area dispel in a
30-foot-radius burst. The dispel check is 1d20+10.

**Construct Traits:** A psion-killer has immunity to poison, *sleep*
effects, paralysis, stunning, disease, death effects, necromancy
effects, mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions, phantasms,
patterns, and morale effects), and any effect that requires a Fortitude
save unless it also works on objects or is harmless. It is not subject
to critical hits, nonlethal damage, ability damage, ability drain,
fatigue, exhaustion, or energy drain. It cannot heal damage, but it can
be repaired.

**Immunity to Psionics (Ex):** Psion-killers completely resist psionic
effects that are subject to power resistance.

### CONSTRUCTION

A psion-killer’s body is constructed from massive blocks of quartz
crystal with a total weight of at least 5,000 pounds and costing at
least 8,000 gp. Assembling the body requires a DC 20 Craft (sculpting)
check or a DC 20 Craft (stonemasonry) check.

ML 16th; Craft Construct, *bend reality*, *dispel psionics*,
*fabricate*, *mind seed*, manifester must be at least 16th level; Price
150,000 gp; Cost 79,000 gp + 5,680 XP.

Puppeteers do not speak, though they can speak indirectly using a host
body’s vocal cords, in whatever language the host knows (usually
Common).

### COMBAT 

Puppeteers use their psionic powers in conjunction with their enthrall
ability to gain control over potential hosts. Once it is in control, a
puppeteer almost exclusively relies on the host’s mental and physical
abilities, although it can use its own powers to enhance their
effectiveness in a particularly dangerous situation.

**Enthrall (Ex):** If a puppeteer is in physical contact with a person
it has charmed (the puppeteer establishes a physical hold by means of
slender infiltrating tendrils), the subject acts as if dominated.
(Puppeteers often seek to charm victims first and then “ask” to be
picked up.) So long as the puppeteer remains in contact with the victim,
the domination remains in effect, even if a check would normally
indicate that the effect is broken.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** 3/day— *detect psionics, mental barrier, psionic
charm* (DC 13)*.* Manifester level 1st. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

**Blindsight (Ex):** A puppeteer can ascertain creatures by nonvisual
means within 60 feet.

**Hide Mind (Su):** A puppeteer cannot be identified as psionic by
divination spells or clairsentience powers.

**Host Protection (Ex):** A puppeteer in control of a host is treated as
an attended magic item for the purpose of making saving throws, even if
the puppeteer is specifically targeted. A puppeteer that is attached to
its host is treated as a creature in a grapple for the purpose of
striking at the puppeteer instead of the host (but the host is not
considered grappled in turn).

**Telepathy (Su):** A puppeteer can communicate telepathically with any
creature within 20 feet that has a language.

Temporal filchers do not speak.

### COMBAT

**Improved Grab (Ex):** To use this ability, a temporal filcher must hit
a creature of Large size or smaller with two claw attacks. It can then
attempt to start a grapple as a free action without provoking attacks of
opportunity. If it wins the grapple check, it establishes a hold and
uses its time filch ability.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*chameleon*, *distract* (DC 13),
*psionic dimension door*, *psionic levitate*, *wall walker;* 3/
day—*mental barrier*. Manifester level 8th. The save DC is
Charisma-based.

**Time Filch (Su):** If a temporal filcher successfully grapples a Large
or smaller creature, it latches onto the opponent’s body and shifts 7
minutes forward in time as a free action. Observers (if any) see the
temporal filcher and its prey disappear in a shimmer, then reappear 7
minutes later in exactly the orientation and condition they left. For
the filcher and its prey, no time passes at all. The victim must succeed
on a Will save (DC 16) or be dazed for 1 round from temporal
disorientation. The ability is otherwise identical to *time hop*
manifested by an 8th-level manifester.

Thought eaters do not speak.

### COMBAT

A thought eater can spend a maximum of 10 continuous rounds on the
Material Plane before its wispy flesh finally dissipates and it falls
dead. If badly wounded, it escapes to the Ethereal Plane rather than
continuing the fight.

**Eat Thoughts (Su):** A thought eater can drain psionic power points
with a successful melee touch attack. Each touch drains 6 power points
from the opponent (or fewer, if the opponent has fewer than 6 points
remaining). Against a nonpsionic creature or a psionic creature that
currently has no power points, this touch attack instead deals 1 point
of Intelligence damage, which provides nourishment equivalent to 6 power
points.

A thought eater requires 12 power points per day to survive but will
gorge itself on weak prey.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*detect psionics*, *distract* (DC 13),
*precognition, psionic daze* (DC 13\*)*;* 3/day—*thought shield.*

Manifester level 3rd. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the thought eater’s manifester level.

**Ethereal Jaunt (Su):** A thought eater can shift from the Ethereal
Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and then shift
back again as a free action. The ability is otherwise identical to the
*psionic ethereal jaunt* power.

### COMBAT

A thought slayer can spend a maximum of 10 continuous minutes on the
Material Plane before its wispy flesh finally dissipates and it falls
dead. If badly wounded, it escapes to the Ethereal Plane rather than
continuing the fight.

**Mind-Consuming Gaze (Su):** Instantly kill (by draining the mind
away), range 30 feet, Fortitude DC 19 negates. The save DC is
Charisma-based. This is considered a mind-affecting death effect. If a
thought slayer’s gaze is met indirectly (such as through a mirror or a
reflection in water), the opponent does not die on a failed save but
instead is dazed for 14 rounds. This otherwise is a gaze effect*.*

The gaze cannot affect creatures on the Material Plane while the thought
slayer remains ethereal, but it can affect ethereal creatures while the
thought slayer is on the Material Plane.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*brain lock* (any nonmindless, DC 14\*),
*chameleon*, *detect psionics*, *distract* (DC 13); 3/day—*body
adjustment* (5d12\*), *mental barrier* (+6 AC, 2 rounds\*)*, mind trap*
(10 rounds\*), *precognition*, *wall walker;* 1/day—*escape detection.*
Manifester level 14th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

\*Includes augmentation for the thought slayer’s manifester level.

**Ethereal Jaunt (Su):** A thought slayer can shift from the Ethereal
Plane to the Material Plane as part of any move action, and then shift
back again as a free action. The ability is otherwise identical to the
*psionic ethereal jaunt* power.

COMBAT

An udoroot can be killed only if its root is dug up or exposed, then
burned, hacked apart, or otherwise destroyed. Severing or destroying all
six crowns puts the plant out of commission, allowing excavation of the
helpless root. The crowns are Medium objects with a hardness of 5 and 7
hit points. To sever a crown, an opponent must use the sunder action.
The crowns can also be affected by spells or effects that affect an area
or targeted by spells that affect an individual target.

An udoroot takes no damage from having a crown severed or destroyed. A
severed crown dies and can no longer be used to attack, but the udoroot
takes no other penalties. As long as the root system remains intact, the
crown regrows in about a month.

**Double Manifest (Ex):** An udoroot senses its surroundings and
manifests its psi-like abilities through its crowns. It can manifest two
psi-like abilities per round, as long as it has at least two crowns
remaining.

**Psi-Like Abilities:** At will—*energy stun* (electricity, 2d6, DC
15\*), *false sensory input* (DC 15), *id insinuation* (two targets, DC
15\*), *mind thrust* (ML 4th, 4d10, DC 14\*), *telekinetic force* (275
lb., DC 15\*), *thought shield* (power resistance 16\*); 3/day—*astral
construct* (3rd level\*), *body adjustment, mental barrier.*

Manifester level 6th. The save DCs are Charisma-based.

An udoroot can use its *body adjustment* power to repair damage to one
of its crowns, as long as the crown has not been severed or destroyed.

\*Includes augmentation for the udoroot’s manifester level.

**Blindsight (Ex):** An udoroot can ascertain all foes by nonvisual
means within 60 feet. If its crowns are destroyed, it can no longer
perceive its surroundings.

**Plant Traits:** An udoroot is immune to poison, *sleep*, paralysis,
stunning, polymorphing, and mind-affecting effects (charms, compulsions,
phantasms, patterns, and morale effects). It is not subject to critical
hits.

An unbodied uses telepathy to communicate with others.

### COMBAT

**Psionic Powers:** An unbodied manifests powers as a 4th-level psion
(telepath). The save DCs are Intelligence-based.

*Typical Psion Powers Known* (power points 21, base save DC 12 + power
level): 1st— *detect psionics, empty mind, mind thrust* (DC 13\*),
*psionic charm* (DC 13\*); 2nd—*brain lock* (DC 14), *cloud mind* (DC
14), *energy push* (DC 14), *read thoughts* (DC 14).

**Telekinetic Force (Su):** An unbodied can use *telekinetic force* (DC
15) as a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity.
Manifester level 4th. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Assume Likeness (Su):** An unbodied can assume the likeness of any
Small, Medium, or Large creature as a standard action that does not
provoke attacks of opportunity. Its abilities do not change, but it
appears to be that creature, relying on its Bluff and Disguise skills to
deflect suspicion.

**Hide Mind (Su):** An unbodied cannot be identified as psionic by
divination spells or clairsentience powers.

**Incorporeal Traits:** An unbodied is harmed only by other incorporeal
creatures, magic weapons, powers, spells, spell-like abilities, and
supernatural abilities. It has a 50% chance to ignore any damage from a
corporeal source, except for force effects or attacks made with ghost
touch weapons. It can pass through solid objects, but not force effects,
at will. Its attacks ignore natural armor, armor, and shields, but
deflection bonuses and force effects work normally against them. An
incorporeal creature always moves silently and cannot be heard with
Listen checks if it doesn’t wish to be.

**Skills:** An unbodied has a +4 racial bonus on Bluff and Disguise
checks. \*When using its assume likeness ability, an unbodied gets an
additional +10 circumstance bonus on Disguise checks. If it can read an
opponent’s mind, it gets a further +4 circumstance bonus on Bluff and
Disguise checks.
